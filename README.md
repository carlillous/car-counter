# car-counter

This implementation takes a video showing traffic on a busy road and, using the OpenCV library in Python, counts how many cars pass through the lanes of one direction of the road.


This project was a submission for the *"Fundamentos de los Sistemas Inteligentes"* course. It is a rather simple and somewhat messy implementation.

**TBD (To Be Done):** Professionalize it a bit more.
